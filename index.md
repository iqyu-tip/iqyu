*iqyu is a mobile web3 platform that tokenizes spacetime by utilizing the Ethereum blockchain and the interplanetary file system (IPFS).*

**...the middleman is dead...**

Initial ERC-721 Use Cases:

- 1)  Safety Deposit Blox 

- 2)  Peer to Peer (P2P) Parking

- 3)  Driveway Rental

- 4)  IPFS Node Creation & Pinning

- 5)  Ticketing

- 6)  Mobile Ethereum Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

The iqyu foundation will be a self-governing distributed autonomous
organization (DAO)

Using blockchain technology and smart contracts, new ideas will be
posted to the DAO and up or down voted. Once an idea gets a high enough
percentage of votes, it is transformed into a proposal for further analysis,
deliberation and modification. After a set time, the modified proposal is
then again up-voted or down-voted and if a high enough percentage of
up-votes occurs, the proposal becomes active policy.
