*iqyu is a mobile web3 platform that tokenizes spacetime by utilizing the Ethereum blockchain and the interplanetary file system (IPFS).*

**...the middleman is dead...**

Initial Use Cases:

- 1)  Safety Deposit Blox 
of growth itself. (Our current economy is operating under the 
illusion that growth is necessary for continued existence, driven by 
greed and subsequent excessive wealth accumulation.)

- 2)  The economy is sustainable and will eventually reach a somewhat 
static equilibrium similar to David Latimer's famous bottle garden 
([https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267504/The-sealed-bottle-garden-thriving-40-years-fresh-air-water.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267504/The-sealed-bottle-garden-thriving-40-years-fresh-air-water.html)).

- 3)  Due to changes in population, efficiencies, innovations, ecology, 
climate, etc., economic expansions and contractions will occur and 
none of these natural changes and fluctuations should ever be feared.

- 4)  Knowing that Earth has a somewhat fixed mass and fixed energy flux, 
a sustainable, quasi-static equilibrium must eventually occur in an 
organically growing, somewhat closed system.

The iqyu foundation will be a self-governing distributed autonomous
organization (DAO)
[https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work)).
Using blockchain technology and smart contracts, new ideas will be
posted to the DAO and up or down voted. Once an idea gets a high enough
percentage of votes, it is transformed into a proposal for further analysis,
deliberation and modification. After a set time, the modified proposal is
then again up-voted or down-voted and if a high enough percentage of
up-votes occurs, the proposal becomes active policy.
